# Python Pandas Data Analysis Tutorial

Hi welcome to this exciting Python and Pandas Data Analysis and UI tutorial. Pandas is an excellent library to analyze data and visualise them in ways that we can understand whats going on and also Python is such as amazing language and it makes it so much easier for to understand complicated computational process in simplified ways. In this tutorial we will be doing 2 very important things 1 we will do some Data Analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib. 2 we will create a simple user interface that will run in the terminal using some Unicode Emoji's (why not, right!) and make it into a workable project that will load data, create the data frames we need, search the data frame, add totals, create bar charts and much more. See the lesson objectives below for more detail.

Lesson Objectives: 

- Understand how to Use Pandas Data Analysis
- Understand how to work with Python for User Inputs
- Load CSV files and create the DataFrame in Pandas
- Use Loc and iLoc in Pandas to arrange and columns
- Use Loc to search for Items in the data started
- Create a User Interface using Python
- Allow users to input choices from a Menu
- Use While loops with muliple Boolean expressions to capture user input
- Respond to the user choices and perform appropriate actions
- Check if the searches exists in the data and return error back to users
- Sort values in the data frame either in asending or desending order
- Reset the index values for the data frame after the changes been made
- Allow users to search for single Items
- Allow users to search for range of dates with start and end
- Add columns in specific locations in the data frame
- Calculate the total sales of items in the data set
- Use Matplotlib to create the Bar Chart using this data set and user searches
- Use Unicode Emoji's with Python to show Icons in the Terminal
